# Human Content Policy

Open source contributions are only productive when everyone involved has a mutual respect for each others' time. As such, **this project has a zero tolerance policy against the use of generative machine learning systems** (e.g. Copilot and other LLMs). This includes the use of any such systems that are integrated into GitHub.

Generative machine learning systems may not be used to generate any content that is submitted to this project. This includes but is not limited to: code, assets, commit descriptions, documentation, issue reports, and comments. Endorsement of generative machine learning systems within any submitted content will be considered equivalent to their use and subject to the same penalties.

Anyone who violates this policy will receive an immediate and permanent ban from this project. This is a zero tolerance policy - no warnings will be given.

## Reasons

These reasons are offered for informational purposes only. They do not represent the sum of my reasoning for this policy, nor are they to be seen as an opportunity for debate.

1. A fundamental expectation of respect for my time.
2. LLMs are incapable of accurately conveying meaning due to an inherent lack of intentionality. This results in sequences of words or tokens that may superficially correlate with the intended problem statement, but which often contain unintended inaccuracies or deviations. Among other problems, this leads to miscommunications and frustrates the peer review process.
3. LLMs systematically launder stolen labour. Beyond the obvious moral implications, this also makes it impossible to determine whether the output is a derivative work of copyrighted material.
4. Environmental concerns.
